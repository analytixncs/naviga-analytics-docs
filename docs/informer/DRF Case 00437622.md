### Opening Balances

We will get the opening balances from a dataset based on the **GL Summary** mapping.  

The dataset is [[NAVIGA]-Opening Balances](https://drfbi.navigahub.com/datasets/admin:naviga-opening-balances)



It will have the following fields:

- **id** - this will be our join key -> year*gl code
- **Opening Balance** - This is the only value that we will pull into our main dataset.
- **year**
- **bf Credits** 
- **bf Debits**

### Main Report

The main report will pull from **GL Detail** mapping.

**Inputs Needed:**

- **Posted Period** - The "current" period the report is being run for.
- **Period Year** - What year is the report running for
- **Last Run Date** - The last date that the report was run. This date is used to determine if there was activity since the Last run date.  

**Output Fields:**

- **Curr Period Debit Minus Credit Total** - Current Period Debit/Credit amount.  If you are running for period 10, this will include any credits/debits with a Financial Period field = 2023-10

- **Year Activity Debit Minus Credit Total** - Activity from the beginning of the year to the end of period prior to our current period.

  *ACTIVITY.DEBIT - ACTIVITY.CREDIT = RESULT.ACTIVITY_YEAR*

- **Opening Balance** - From the GL Summary dataset, opening balance for previous year.

  *OPENING.BALANCE.DEBIT - OPENING.BALANCE.CREDIT = RESULT.BEGINNING_YEAR*

- **Active Since Last Run** - either "No Activity" or "Activity".  This is just looks to see if any of the GL Detail transaction's Posted Dates are AFTER the Last Run Date entered as an Input.

**Possible Calculations**

- **Ending Balance as of First of year through Period before Report Period** = *Opening Balance* + *Year Activity Debit Minus Credit Total*

The posted period is not used in the criteria, but is used when aggregating to determine if the money should summed for the Year to summing or the current period summing.

### Powerscripts

**Calc Aggregation**

```javascript
// Define your group keys on the $record object so that
// you can reuse them in the Post Aggregation function
$record.groupKey1 = `${$record['accountNo']}`;
groupKeys = [
  {
    name: "GL Code",
    groupKey: $record.groupKey1,
  },
];


currMonthInput = moment($inputs['postedPeriod']).format("MM")
prevMonthInput = currMonthInput - 1

dataMonth = moment($record['finPeriod']).format("MM")


isPrevActivity = dataMonth < currMonthInput
isCurrentActivity = dataMonth === currMonthInput

groupAggr = [
  {
    name: "currPeriodCR",
    initValue: 0,
    value: isCurrentActivity ? $record['crAmt'] : 0,
  },
  {
    name: "currPeriodDR",
    initValue: 0,
    value: isCurrentActivity ? $record['dbAmt'] : 0,
  },
  {
    name: "yearActivityCR",
    initValue: 0,
    value: isPrevActivity ? $record['crAmt'] : 0,
  },
  {
    name: "yearActivityDR",
    initValue: 0,
    value: isPrevActivity ? $record['dbAmt'] : 0,
  }, 
  {
    name: "activeSinceLastRun",
    initValue: 0,
    value: moment($record['posted']).isAfter(moment($inputs['lastRunDate'])) ? 1 : 0,
  }, 
];

// Calling the calculate aggregates in a Powerscript
naviga.calculateAggregates({ $local, groupKeys, groupAggr });
```



**Post Aggregation**

```js
// Get the group keys you defined in your Calc aggregations Powerscript
groupKey1 = $record.groupKey1

// GROUP KEY 1
if (!$local[groupKey1].GroupSet) {
  // Calculate Current Period Activity
  $record.CurrPeriodCredit_Total = $local[groupKey1].currPeriodCR;
  $record.CurrPeriodDebit_Total = $local[groupKey1].currPeriodDR;
  $record.CurrPeriodDebitMinusCredit_Total = $local[groupKey1].currPeriodDR - $local[groupKey1].currPeriodCR;
  
  // Calculate Previous Year Activity
  $record.YearActivityCredit_Total = $local[groupKey1].yearActivityCR;
  $record.YearActivityDebit_Total = $local[groupKey1].yearActivityDR;
  $record.YearActivityDebitMinusCredit_Total = $local[groupKey1].yearActivityDR - $local[groupKey1].yearActivityCR;
  
  $record.activeSinceLastRun = $local[groupKey1].activeSinceLastRun > 0 ? "Active" : "No Activity"

  $local[groupKey1].GroupSet = true; //Setting to true means we will not excute this code again during the load.
} else {
    $omit()
}
```

OPENING.BALANCE.DEBIT - OPENING.BALANCE.CREDIT = RESULT.BEGINNING_YEAR
